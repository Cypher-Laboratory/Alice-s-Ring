ALICE’S RING - SOFTWARE LICENSE

PREAMBLE

The solution 

CYPHER LAB, a company which designs cryptographic computer protocols, has developed an algorithmic solution named “ALICE’S RING”, a TypeScript library which provides a set of tools to aggregate data to produce tangible proofs while ensuring that the on-chain identity, valuable assets, and transaction history of users remain protected. From these tools, numerous modules will emerge to cover all possible use cases.

ALICE’S RING relies on “ring signature”, a zero-knowledge proof method which consists in a type of digital signature that can be performed by any member of a set of entities that each have a public key, allowing it to prove ownership of an asset without revealing its identity. 

Thanks to its interoperability, ALICE’S RING supports multiple blockchains while keeping privacy protection intact. In order to minimize trust requirements, ALICE’S RING relies solely on public on-chain and off-chain data.

Use of third-party libraries

ALICE’S RING is built upon other free libraries. Third-party libraries used by ALICE’S RING are under the MIT license () and ISC license () which grant permission to use, copy, modify and distribute the software for any purpose. In making this source code available, it can be used under the terms of these licenses. 

The copyright notice and permission notice of both licenses used by ALICE’S RING should appear in all copies of ALICE’S RING created under the terms of this license, among all other mandatory notices mentioned hereinafter.

The license 

ALICE’S RING license is applied for any use of ALICE’S RING Source Code part that CYPHER LAB agrees to share, and which consists mainly in the ring signature solution. The other part of ALICE RING’S Source Code (mainly the process of data collection and data aggregation in rings) will never not be disclosed nor shared, and must be considered as strictly confidential, private and could not be used by anyone but CYPHER LAB or with CYPHER LAB’S prior express written and signed consent.
