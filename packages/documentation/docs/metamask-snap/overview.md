## Introduction
With the Ring Signature Snap, users can create and import Ethereum accounts, sign messages using Spontaneous Anonymous Group (SAG) and Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (LSAG) signatures, and verify these signatures. This Snap ensures that users can sign messages privately, with the option to reveal linkage across multiple messages without revealing the actual signer.

## What is a Snap?

MetaMask Snaps is an open-source system that allows developers to safely extend the functionality of MetaMask, creating new web3 end-user experiences. A Snap can add new API methods to MetaMask, support different blockchain protocols, or modify existing functionalities using the Snaps JSON-RPC API.

Snaps enable users to interact with new blockchains, protocols, and decentralized applications (dApps) beyond what is natively supported by MetaMask. The goal of the MetaMask Snaps system is to create a more open, customizable, and extensible wallet experience for users, fostering innovation and collaboration within the blockchain and decentralized application ecosystem.

Developers can write MetaMask Snaps using JavaScript, making it accessible and convenient for a broad range of developers to create custom solutions. Users can then opt to install these Snaps to enhance their MetaMask experience, provided they trust the source of the Snap.
