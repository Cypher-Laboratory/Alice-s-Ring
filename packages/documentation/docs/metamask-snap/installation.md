### Installing the Snap
To install the Ring Signature Snap, you need to have the MetaMask browser extension installed. You can manually install the Snap from the [MetaMask Snap Store](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/cypher-laboratory/alicesring-snap/) or install it automatically when a DApp requests it.

The easiest way to interact with the Ring Signature Snap is by using the Ring Signature Snap toolkit. The toolkit simplifies the process of utilizing the Snapâ€™s functionalities and can be easily integrated into your project.

You can find the toolkit on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypher-laboratory/alicesring-snap-sdk) and its source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-snap-toolkit).

### Installing the Toolkit

You can install the toolkit via npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install @cypher-laboratory/alicesring-snap-sdk
```

or

```sh
yarn add @cypher-laboratory/alicesring-snap-sdk
