--- 

Alice's Ring is an open source and community-driven project that aims to enhance privacy in the WEB3 ecosystem through Ring Signatures. Our mission is to shape a future where privacy is an integral part of the digital experience.

It offers a suite of libraries that provide developers with the tools to integrate ring signature schemes into their decentralized applications. These libraries are written in various programming languages, making them versatile and accessible to a broad spectrum of developers.

### What Alice's Ring Offers
Alice's Ring includes implementations in:

1. **TypeScript**: Ideal for front-end development and integration into web applications, allowing for easier interaction with blockchain systems.
2. **Rust**: Known for its performance and security, the Rust library provides a robust implementation of ring signature schemes, suitable for high-performance in your applications.
3. **Solidity**: Designed for the Ethereum ecosystem, the Solidity library enables the use of ring signatures directly within smart contracts, promoting privacy in on-chain transactions.
4. **Cairo**: A language tailored for StarkNet, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, the Cairo library allows developers to use ring signatures efficiently within the StarkNet ecosystem.

These libraries aim to provide a flexible and secure foundation for developers to integrate ring signature-based privacy features into their decentralized applications, regardless of the specific blockchain or development environment.


This website provides resources, documentation, and updates on Alice's Ring project. Stay tuned for more exciting developments from Alice's Ring. Together, we can build a more private and secure WEB3 ecosystem!

### In this documentation:

- [SAG-ts](./SAG-ts): TypeScript implementation of a ring signature scheme called Spontaneous Anonymous Group (SAG) signatures.
- [LSAG-ts](./LSAG-ts): TypeScript implementation of a linkable ring signature scheme called Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (LSAG) signatures.
- [Metamask-snap](./metamask-snap): A Metamask snap to create and verify ring signatures easily.
- [SAG evm verifier](./SAG-evm-verifier): EVM verifier for SAG ring signature written in Solidity.
- [Rust verifier](./rust-verifier): Rust verifier for SAG and LSAG ring signatures.

> Note:
> You can find a complete explanation of SAG and LSAG differences and usages in the [Ring Signatures](./ring-signatures) documentation.
